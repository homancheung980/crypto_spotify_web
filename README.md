WHAT IT DOES--------------------
A webpage that allows you to generate a playlist based on the crypto of your choice: Bitcoin or Ethereum.


HOW IT WORKS--------------------
Here I used Sublime text editor to edit the 3 codes: bitcoin_spotify.py , app.py and index.html


API USED--------------------
Spotify API: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
Crypto API: https://www.coinlore.com/cryptocurrency-data-api


NOTES--------------------
In the bitcoin_spotify code, please make sure you have prepared your own Spotify api keys which will looks like this:
{
    "username": <Your ID code here>
    "client_id": <Your client_id here>
    "client_secret": <Your client_secret here>
    "redirect": <Your redirect link> *please make sure its a string
}
*Please keep this dictionary key name the same for conveniency.
